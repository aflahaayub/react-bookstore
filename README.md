# React Book Store Project

## Book Store

Book Store is a web project where the user can add 1-5 amount of books in a cart.
When the user interact with the cart, there'll be a list of books that the user want to buy, the price, the total amount of book, and the total price.
User can also add more book or delete the book from the cart.
This project give me an example on how to use React Hooks like useRef, useReducer, useContext, useEffect, useState.

Command to run the project are:

```
npm i

npm start

```
